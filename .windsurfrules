I work in windows 11.

The goal is to build a standalone application for win11.
python based.

Main feature:
 - adds a shortcut that works everywhere! (i.e. every text field, browser, etc)
 - while shortcut is hold, it records audio via built-in microphone
 - if released, stores to file, and transcribes it using two possible models.
 - transcription is inserted (simulated keypress or pasted somehow? should work everywhere where text can be enerted, should support khmer language.)
 - during recording and transcription, there is a small elegant overlay that shows the current state at bottom of screen
 - shows tray icon if running. when clicked, opens settings dialog
 - in settings, api keys can be set (for google and elevenlabs)
 - use two transcriptions models for now, with possibility to add more in the future: gemini flash and elevenlabs
 - possibility to set language in settings windows (adapt in gemini prompt and in elevenlabs api call accordingly. Probably need to store a mapping for all lanugages and codes or use package that provides this since gemini and needs full name (in the prompt) and elevenlabs uses iso code)
 - possibility to change shortcut in settings. Have ctrl+alt+space as default. 
 - use windows credentials manager to store api keys
 - use qt for gui
 - have whole gui in english as well as khmer with selector
 - when closed, minimize to tray
 - audtostart option
 - single instance detection


 for any request I make, it is very helpful if you try to find all files that might be relevant and read them.
 In full! most mistakes you make or issues you try to fix but can't are because you don't fully understand the context and how things are interacting and supposed to work. Don't just assume. Check your assumptions.
